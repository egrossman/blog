    "\n",
    "Many topics in Natural Language Processing seem like they would be trivial to solve. Take the case of finding synonyms or antonyms for a word in a sentence. All you have to do is look up the word in a thesaurus and find a suitable replacement. Our dictionaries like Miriam Webster or Oxford are essentially databases. Surely we can just do a lookup, right? That's O(1) complexity! In my example above - \"A Dandelion by any other name would reek just as candy\" is a play on Shakespeare's words \"A rose by any other name would be just as sweet\". I've replaced three words manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rose -> Dandelion**: These are not true synonyms, but they are both flowers. A human might find them to be a suitable replacement, but this is NOT what we want to solve. In fact, this is a replacement that a language model might make since the **sense** of the sentence is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sweet -> Candy**: The word sweet could refer to a cookie or any other sugary confectionery. This is a synonym, but it doesn't preserve the sense of the sentence. The original meaning is describing the taste/smell of sugar. The word **pleasant** would maintain the meaning of the original sentence, but instead we choose the wrong meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smell -> Reek**: This is a correct synonym change for the sentence, although it does change the connotation of the sentence. The sense of the word is preserved, but reek implies that the smell is bad! In looking at a thesaurus, the word **smack** would be more appropriate, but it's also more colloquial than the simple word **smell**."
