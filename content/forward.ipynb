    "The purpose of this diary is to chronicle my research in various topics around machine learning. It will contain a mix of experimentation, data exploration, reading and summarizing papers, and replicating state of the art models. I believe that taking a slower more deliberate approach to strudying will prove more effective than simply working on a project or kaggle competition."
